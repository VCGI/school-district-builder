### **Enhancements**

* **Report Component Charting Improvements:**  
  * The "Grand List per Student" and "Average Daily Membership" charts now have bar colors that are consistent with the district colors used throughout the application.  
  * Key reference lines and ticks have been added to the "Average Daily Membership" chart at the 4000 and 8000 ADM levels to provide better visual context.  
  * The title of the "Average Daily Membership" chart has been updated to "Average Daily Membership (FY25 PreK-12)" for improved clarity.  
  * The spacing for the x-axis labels on the report charts is now dynamic, which reduces unnecessary white space when district names are short.
